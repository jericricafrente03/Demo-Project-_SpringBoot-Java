Java Spring Boot with JPA and PostgreSQL Example
This repository contains a simple example of a Java Spring Boot application integrated with JPA (Java Persistence API) for data persistence and PostgreSQL as the database.

Overview
Java Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building Java-based web applications with minimal configuration. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for developing robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

JPA, on the other hand, is a Java specification for managing relational data in applications. It provides a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to database tables and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system known for its reliability, robustness, and extensibility. It's widely used in enterprise-level applications for storing and managing structured data.

Features
Spring Boot: Quickly bootstrap your application with minimal setup and configuration.
JPA: Simplify database access and management using object-relational mapping.
PostgreSQL: Utilize a powerful and scalable relational database management system.
CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database entities.
Dependency Management: Manage project dependencies easily using Maven or Gradle.
